v1.4.1 -> v1.4.2
----------------
- Previously, I was not doing a "swap" on a VC hit if there was still room in the VC.
Now, I do the swap even if there is extra space.
- Fixed a bug where prefetch hits were counting towards useful prefetches.

v1.4 -> v1.4.1
--------------
- Rolled back a dumb mistake I made in 1.4

v1.3 -> v1.4
------------
- Fixed a bug which occurred when prefetching in to a set with no valid blocks,
or where the LRU timestamp is 0. Make sure to never make LRU timestamp negative!


v1.2 -> v1.3
------------
- Fixed a bug where I sometimes counted write_backs when moving blocks from VC to L1.


v1.1 -> v1.2
------------
- AAT now calculated with VC miss rate not L1 miss rate.
- Prefetched insertions now only consider valid blocks when calculating LRU timestamp.
- Fixed a bug where I accidentally double-counted blocks for bytes_transferred.
- Fixed some logic related to write backs.


v1.0 -> v1.1
------------
- Prefetch insertions are now LRU instead of MRU
- Fixed a bug with bytes_transferred where it wouldn't count for non-prefetches
- Prefetch hits no longer promote block to MRU
- Prefetches now also affect bytes_transferred even if they hit in the cache
